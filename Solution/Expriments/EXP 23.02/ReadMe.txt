we decided to try the learn process with inserting the hexagon shape instead of angleCross, as we thought maybe the similarity between the angleCrosses and the straightCrosses
can be the reason that system recognizes the maximom similarity of these two categories highere even that the similarity of each category to itself.

regarding this change, the similarity issue mentioned above and other last experiments is not seen anymore. but the max similarity for each category is not satisfieng enough.
on the other hand we still try to find a soloution that system doesnt recognize these to mentioned categoties more similar to each other than to the other one.



In the next step I would also check the impact of variying ColumnDimension parameter on the learning process and resualts of the system, when we reduce it to half, and dounle it
in the next experiments.
