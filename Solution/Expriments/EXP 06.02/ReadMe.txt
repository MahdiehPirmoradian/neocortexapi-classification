by decreasing the PotencialRaadious to half (to 15) its observed that all similarities are reduce drastically once again.
we are not experiencing the issue with PotencialRadious of 30 (which was higher similarity between two different categories
compared to se similarity of the category to itself). but the extream low maximal similarity of each category is not reliable enough.
the system also shows a better performance recognizing similarity of the angleCross category to itselm, in comparison to the 
max similarity of other two shapes to themselves! Interesting !
