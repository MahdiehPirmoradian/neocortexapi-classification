after a huge increase of PotencilRadious up to 120 to observe the result of learning and recognition of the entries, the same issue of wrong similarities
between different categories is happening. as we are experiencing a drastic decrease of similarity percentage in each category, we can see again that as
 shown in the result, the Max similarity between StraightCross and AngleCross is more than the Max similarity of StraghtCross to its own category members.
(the same issue with the PotencialRadious of 30)


Resault : maybe a PotencialRadious around 60 could be a good option, but with such a PotencialRadious, due to low similarity percentge of the shapes to 
their own caategories, we need an optimisation in order to reach a reliable similarity percentage of each category.


Plan: investigating the effect of PotencialRadious with a value lower than 30 .
