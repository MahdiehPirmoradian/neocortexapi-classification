activating GlobalInhibition using localAreaDensity of 0.8

here we see the overlap of straightCross and triangle, the whole correlation percentages are
 above 90% with an unacceptable safemargine.

the higher the localAreaDensity causes that the system sees all the shapes some how similar.

a true prediction of 100% and false predictions over 90% provides an unreliable prediction safe margine
