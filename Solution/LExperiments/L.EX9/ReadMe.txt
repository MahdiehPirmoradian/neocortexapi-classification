activating NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea Parameter and assigning 90 to it
in the same time turning the localAreaDensity off by assigning -1 to it

a very small increment of correlation between different categories


the prediction is decremented from 46 to 43% but still completely acceptable and good, also with a good safe margine
