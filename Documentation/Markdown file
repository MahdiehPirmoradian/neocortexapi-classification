This work is a new approach to image classification based on HTM algorithm.


In the previous work at the university an Image Classification solution has been implemented. 
Your task is to implement a program that uses the existing solution (add reference to it) as a library and start a training of learning images. 
You are free to design or find the experiment image data to be used in the experiment. This can be plants, animals or whatever.
Your task is to change various learning parameters and to find the best fit that shows image classification. Most important learning parameters are:

Global/Local Inhibition, 
Potential Radius, 
Local Area Density and 
NumofActiveColumnsPerInArea. 

Demonstrate how these parameters influence the learning. 
Your code must provide the learning code and prediction code. After learning user should use your code and test the quality of learning. 
For example, the user after learning enter the image “table”. The prediction code provide a set of predicting results like: “Table – 87%, chair 7%, light - 3%”.
… 
Our code must provide Learning and Prediction code
