activating GlobalInhibition using localAreaDensity of 0.7

no overlap observable, but the safe margin of correlation is not acceptable.
the higher the localAreaDensity causes that the system sees all the shapes some how similar.

a true prediction of 98 and false predictions over 80% provides an unriliable prediction safe margine
