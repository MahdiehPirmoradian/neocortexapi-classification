activating NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea Parameter and assigning 60 to it
in the same time turning the localAreaDensity off by assigning -1 to it

compared to last exp with NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea  of 50, the predicction 
got just alittle bit better,but but the safety margine of prediction is increased, by lowered wrong predicctions
