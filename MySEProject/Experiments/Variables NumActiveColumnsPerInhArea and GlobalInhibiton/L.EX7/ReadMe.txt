activating NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea Parameter and assigning 70 to it
in the same time turning the localAreaDensity off by assigning -1 to it
the correlation of each category to itself is interestingly increased, but correlation of different categories to 
eachother isnt increased that much. this caused an acceptable safe margin of correlations
compared to last exp with NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea  of 60, the predicction accuracy is also 
increased 24 to 37% with a good safe margine
