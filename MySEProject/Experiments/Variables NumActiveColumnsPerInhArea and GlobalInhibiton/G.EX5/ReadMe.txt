activating GlobalInhibition using localAreaDensity of 0.5

some increment in similarity of same categories, and also a not unwanted similarity of different categories.
the higher the localAreaDensity causes that the system sees all the shapes some how similar.
the prediction is on 95% during last 3 experiments, but the safety margine has been reducing ganze Zeite
