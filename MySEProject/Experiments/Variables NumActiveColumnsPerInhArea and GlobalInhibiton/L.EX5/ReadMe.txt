activating NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea Parameter and assigning 50 to it
in the same time turning the localAreaDensity off by assigning -1 to it
the results are  Generally getting better, no overlap of categories observed this time 
compared to last exp with NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea  of 40, the predicction got worse,but still
 has a safe margine of around 10% (I consider it as safe because the maximom prediction
 is 21% and second maximom prediction is 9%, that means 50% safe margine of prediction percentage)
